For one group, without contact, full use firebase

The first login will save the email and name as a password, so if the next login name is not appropriate then it cannot log in again

## Usage
1. Copy ** google-services.json ** from the Firebase Console to the directory project app
2. Build a service to send notifications, my example uses ExpressJs [here](https://gist.github.com/masrahman/a5206fb986d9ed975dedab218495d830)
